.SH NAME
update-ca-certificates \- update system CA certificates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update-ca-certificates
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBupdate-ca-certificates\fP updates the directory
/etc/ssl/certs to hold SSL certificates and generates /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem,
a concatenated single-file list of certificates.
.PP
It reads the file /etc/ca-certificates.conf. Each line gives a pathname of
a CA certificate under /usr/share/ca-certificates that should be trusted.
Lines that begin with "#" are comment lines and thus ignored.
Lines that begin with "!" are deselected, causing the deactivation
of the CA certificate in question. All certificates are implicitly
trusted if no trusted certificates are listed.
.PP
Furthermore all certificates found below /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
are also included as implicitly trusted.
.PP
After populating /etc/ssl/certs \fBupdate-ca-certificates\fP invokes
custom hooks in /usr/lib/ca-certificates/update.d/*.run and
/etc/ca-certificates/update.d/*.run. The command line options used
for invoking update-ca-certificates are passed to the hooks as well.
